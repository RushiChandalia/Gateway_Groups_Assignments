Dear Sir,
Please find below the code for Assignment-1

Doubts that I faced while solving the problem:
1) How to separate the time and date from the result or only get date not time?
2) Is it possible to use the inbuilt methods on array-like find or filter for this?
3) how to dynamically Add objects to an array instead of hard coding it?

Waiting for your valuable feedback.
